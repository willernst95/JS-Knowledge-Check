    # JavaScript Review / Checkup
​
For JavaScript let’s take a look at some of the core concepts for JS and see if we can figure out specific deficiencies 
or target areas. Some of this might be straight-forward some of it might not be but it’s going to help us get you to 
where you need to be. I’d like you to try and work through this and answer what you can / provide examples if you can. 
After you work through this, I can provide notes / references as needed and/or meet up before or after class 
for more 1:1 review / support.
​
## Objects
​
- What is an object in Javascript?
<!-- An object is what goes into a variable (had to look this up)-->
- If you have the following object, how would you get the person's last name:
​
```javascript
let person = {
  name: {
    last: "Smith",
    first: "John",
  },
  age: 45,
};
```
<!-- person.last or person[last] -->
​
## Loops
​
- What is a for loop and when would you use one?
<!-- A for loop is a loop that runs a number of times, you would use one when creating an array -->
- What is the default structure of a for loop?
<!-- let function = (); {for()} -->
- If you have to run a loop for all numbers from 1 to 100 what would that look like?
<!-- let function = (x); -->
<!-- for (i=1; i < 101; i++ ) -->

- What is a while loop and when would you use one?
<!-- runs until a condition is false, the example is the coin toss but idk when else to use it -->
- What is the basic structure of a while loop?
<!-- while(condition is met) run(x) -->
- Will this loop ever end?
​
  ```javascript
  let bool = true;
  while(bool){
      console.log("loop is running");
  ```
  <!-- no, it wouldn't become false at any point -->
​
  ## Comparisons
​
  - With the following code, what will be logged to the console?
​
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  let y = 20;
  if (x > y) {
    console.log("X is larger");
  } else {
    console.log("Y is larger");
  }
  ```
  <!-- X is larger -->
​
  - How do you check to see if two conditions are true such as `x < 10` AND `x > 0`?
  <!-- if (x < 10 && x > 5) -->
  - How do you check to see if either condition is true such as `x > 10` OR `x < 5`?
  <!-- if (x > 10 || x < 5)-->
  - Which of the following if statements (or would they both be) would be true?
​
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  let y = "10";
  if (x == y) {
  }
  if (x === y) {
  }
  ```
  <!-- I believe its ==, because === requires it to be strictly equal which it wouldn't be because y is a string -->
​
  - If you're using `x == y` or `x === y` how would you check to see if `x` is NOT equal to `y`?
  <!-- != or !== -->
  - When would you use `else` or `else if(){}`?
<!-- ​else if it's the final possibility, or 1 of 2, else if if it creates a 3rd of higher possibility of something -->
  ## Functions
​
  - What are functions in javascript?
  <!-- let, var, const but let is easiest to use -->
  - What does the `return` keyword do in a function?
  <!-- returns a value -->
  - Assuming you have the following function, how would you invoke (or trigger) the function?
​
  ```javascript
  function myFunction() {}
  ```
  <!-- myFunction (had to look this one up) -->
​
  - Taking the following lines of code, when you call the function as below, what are the values of `name` and `age` inside of the function?
​
    ```javascript
    function sayHello(name, age) {}
    sayHello("Mike", 12);
    ```
    <!-- Mike and 12, hope this isn't a trick question -->
​
  - What is scope or more specifically, if you create a variable inside of a function can the code outside of the function access that variable?
  <!-- the variable would only exist inside the function that created it -->
​
  ## The DOM
​
  - What is the DOM and why might it be important?
  <!-- Document object model, I believe it allows you to look at code in a browser to see what the viewer would see -->
  - Assuming you have the following piece of code in your HTML, how would you use javascript to grab that element: `<div id="container"></div>`
  <!-- document.getElementById("container") -->
  - What is the difference between `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll`?
  <!-- I think Selector only chooses one element where SelectorAll selects all -->
  - How would you and/or what tool would you use to repeat code every X seconds?
  <!-- lettimeout? -->
  - How would you have some code run only once after X seconds has passed?
  <!-- I'm not sure -->
  - Assuming you have the following line of code, how would you change the background color of the `myDiv` element using only javascript?
​
  ```javascript
  let myDiv = document.getElementById("container");
  ```
  <!-- container.background-color: black -->
​
  - How do you add or remove classes to an HTML element in javascript?
  <!-- .remove and .append I think are the terms -->
  - How would you create a new element and then add it to the end of the body?
  <!-- unsure, I think the tag is create element -->
​
  ## Events / Callbacks
​
  - Assuming you have an element with an id of `submit` how would you set up the code to listen for when someone clicks the button?
  <!-- submit.addEventListener("click") -->
  - Taking the following line of code, how would you change the callback into an arrow function?
​
  ```javascript
  someHtmlElement.addEventListener("mouseenter", function () {});
  ```
  <!-- function() => {someHtmlElement.addEventListener("mouseenter")} -->
​
  - If you have an event listener for an element and the callback function below, what is `e` and what is `e.target`?
​
  ```javascript
  someElement.addEventListener("mouseover", function (e) {
    console.log(e.target);
  });
  ```
  <!-- I think e is the object and I think e.target is logged to the console whenever the mouse goes over  -->
​
  ## Generic JavaScript
​
  - How would you get the value of "mike" out of the following array: `let arr = ["mike", "steve", "john"]`?
  <!-- arr[0] -->
  - What is an easy way to loop through all the elements in an array and what would that code look like?
  <!-- no clue -->
  - What does this code do and why might it be important to use this pattern?
​
  ```javascript
  let x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  let y = [...x];
  ```
  <!-- it shows y as x, it would be DRY  -->
​
  - What are prototypical functions and how might you use some of them?
  <!-- unsure -->
  - How can you tell how many elements are in an array named `arr1`
<!-- count them? -->
